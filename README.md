# Book Finder App ðŸ“š

## Description
The **Book Finder App** is a React application that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API. Users can input a book title and click on search button, and the app will fetch and display a list of books with relevant details, such as the title, publication year, author, and description.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for books by title.
- **Dynamic Book Cards**: Display book details in a visually appealing format.
- **Loading State**: Displays a loading message while fetching data.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of errors during API calls.
- **Fallback Values**: Ensures a good user experience by providing default values for missing data.

---

## How It Works
1. **Search**:
   - The `SearchBar` component allows users to input a book title and triggers a search when they click the "Search" button.
2. **Fetch Data**:
   - The app fetches data from the Open Library API based on the user's query.
3. **Display Results**:
   - Results are displayed using `BookCard` components for each book.
